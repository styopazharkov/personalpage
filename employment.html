            <h2>Computer Science Researcher at Stanford University <span class="dates">(June 2021 – Present)</span> </h2>
            <p> This is a research project through Stanford's CURIS Program. I am studying theoretical computer science with four amazing professors—Li-Yang Tan, Moses Charikar, Nima Anari, and Aviad Rubenstein. It started recently, so I can't speak much about it yet.</p>

            <h2>Section Leader for CS 106 at Stanford University <span class="dates">(March 2021 – Present)</span></h2>
            <p>I'm interested in pedagogy and the proper way of teaching. This role as a section leader helped me develop my understanding of this. I led a weekly section for computer science students taking CS 106 at Stanford, I graded homeworks and exams, and I hosted helper hours. I also created syntax review videos for exams and led review sessions for the students. I did this in the Spring quarter of 2021 and am planning on continuing in the Summer.</p>

            <h2>Teacher at the UFM Community Learning Center in Manhattan, KS <span class="dates">(June 2020 – July 2020)</span></h2>
            <p> I have done many math education activities such as leading math club in high school or helping out with the local math circle, but this was my first paid teaching. I taught biweekly mathematics classes for about 30 enthusiastic elementary kids and managed the group/organized classes. The kids were amazing and I loved explaining complex topics in intuitive ways to them.</p>

            <h2>Certified USSF and Manhattan Adult League Referee in KS and MO<span class="dates"> (August 2017 – September 2020)</span></h2>
            <p> This job isn't that relevant to what I do now, but it was a big part of my life, so I decided to include it anyway. I refereed both kids' and adults' soccer games throughout Kansas and Missouri. Through this job, I learned to work well with other people as well as build confidence in communication. After all, breaking up fights and giving out yellow cards is just a more intense version of client communication.</p>
