            This page is a few words about what I do in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, but I speak Russian with my family. I also have been learning French for a few years now. I'm not fluent, but I can keep up a conversation in French. In general, I love talking about languages and their intricacies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks to my family, I'm pretty big on hiking and camping. I try to plan a backpacking trip any time I get the chance. Also, I love snow, so climbing mountains in the summer helps me satisfy my desire to see it.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: add cartoons to this site to be able to mention them here -->
        <p>Although I'm not good at anything but pencil sketches of people and cartoons,
            <!-- (<a href="./img/personal/drawing.jpg">see this example</a>), TODO: uncomment this maybe -->
            I like to draw. My papers, projects, and homeworks always contain plenty of cartoons of a very specific style. Instead of stick figures, I draw people with nonzero thickness. This allows for more emotion. One of my close friends said I should "coin this style", whatever that means. </p>

        <p>
            I also like to pretend that I know web development basics. I am pretty comfortable using the Flask framework to make a website. One of my favorite hobby projects has been making a website for Don't Say Pineapple (DSP), a social game where you try to make your friends say a word over the course of several days. I learned how to make a secure login system and database from that. 
        </p>

            There are things like Argentine tango, night photography, tennis, or cooking that I wish I was good at, but haven't mentioned above. I enjoy most things, so if you're someone who I'll see in person, please introduce me to your hobbies—I'll probably like them.
