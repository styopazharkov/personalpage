        <h1>Here are the materials for CS 359A:</h1>
        <p>[NOTES] The notes for the talk are <a href="cs359a-notes">here</a>. These contain everything we will talk about and more.</p>
        <p>[CHEATSHEET] The cheatsheet that could help keep track of all of the definitions, lemmas, and variables is <a href="cs359a-cheatsheet">here</a>. Having it open during the talk might mitigate the stress of seeing n, k, l, p, and s all in one equation.</p>
        <p>[SLIDES] For those of you who like to follow along by writing, the mostly empty slides are <a href="cs359a-slides">here</a>.</p>
        <p>[SUNFLOWER] If we do not get to proving the sunflower lemma, the short pdf <a href="sunflower">here</a> has a proof (It's directly cropped out of the notes).</p>
