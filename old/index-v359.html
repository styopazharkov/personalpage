        <p>This page is currently under construction and will probably be like this for a while until I fix it. </p>
        <h3>If you're one of my Sectionees:</h3>
        <p>I removed the login system from the section page for a bit, so you can't access the zoom link from here anymore. Remember that the section is on Thursdays at 8:30. You can find the zoom link on Paperless. Don't forget to sign up for IGs this week as well!</p>
